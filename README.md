# Scientific Data Visualization Project
- Professor: Tariq Zeenat

## Overview

This project aims to explore and visualize various aspects of global health and socio-economic indicators using scientific data visualization techniques. The project utilizes datasets sourced from Kaggle and other relevant sources to analyze trends in life expectancy, mortality rates, disease incidence, and the impact of COVID-19 on different regions.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Directory containing the datasets used in the project.
- `code/`: Directory containing Python scripts and notebooks for data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization.
- `reports/`: Directory containing detailed reports summarizing analysis findings and insights.
- `visualizations/`: Directory containing visualizations generated during the project.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Dataset Description

- The project utilizes two main datasets:
  - `world_data.csv`: Contains information on various health and socio-economic indicators for different countries.
  - `covid_data.csv`: Contains COVID-19 data, including confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries, by country/region.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data cleaning and visualization.
- D3.js: Used for initial visualization of uncleaned datasets.
- Microsoft Power BI: Utilized for creating interactive dashboards and reports.
